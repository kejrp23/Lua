# Lua Experiments

This repo is a growing collection of hands-on Lua projects exploring systems thinking, terminal utilities, and embedded logic. The goal is to sharpen low-level coding skills using Lua’s lightweight and expressive core.

## Philosophy

> Code is only useful if you understand what it's doing under the hood.  
> That’s why these projects are built from scratch — no frameworks, no magic.

Each file in this repo was written with minimal dependencies and a focus on:

- Simplicity  
- Portability  
- Developer control  
- Understanding system behavior

## Included Projects

### `task.lua`
A clean terminal-based task switcher with:
- Menu-based interaction  
- Dynamic task lists  
- Screen clearing and user feedback  
- Cross-platform support (Windows/macOS/Linux)

### `people.lua`
A constructor-style example showing:
- Nested data structures  
- Object-like patterns using tables  
- Pretty output formatting

## Why Lua?

Lua’s tables can act as lists, dictionaries, objects, or config containers — all without needing classes, JSON, or third-party modules.

More than a scripting language, Lua is a **systems enabler** — it embeds cleanly in C/C++ environments and is powerful enough to model real-world logic without bloat.

## Future Plans

- Add persistence to `task.lua` (file saving and loading)
- Create reusable logging and database libraries
- Begin embedding Lua in C/C++ programs for hybrid builds
- Explore simple UIs using Love2D
